## What we're about

The Data for Democracy Lab @ UVA is a place to promote the use of data science for the common good. We aspire to a data science that is educative -- working to ensure more people have access to the power of data, that is inclusive -- emphasizing the value of diverse perspectives, experiences, and knowledge, and that is open -- revealing the methods, models, and limits to all and allowing others to adapt, improve, or apply the work. Data for Democracy is about using data science in the service of citizens and those working on behalf of a more just world. 

Initial efforts of the Data for Democracy Lab include the Public Presidency Project and a 1-credit lab, the Public Interest Data Lab, in partnership with UVA's [Data Science Institutek](http://dsi.virginia.edu/) teaching students data skills and methods through experience working on a project for a local agency or nonprofit.

## Who's involved

This is a new effort arising out of the UVA Library, led by Michele Claibourn. Clay Ford from within the Library and Eric Rochester from without provide ideas, feedback, and support. The 2017-2018 StatLab Fellows are working with us as to imagine, design, and implement the work. And we'd love more partners!
