<h2>The Content of Debates</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="../../14/2017-09-14-debate-watch/">complexity</a> and the <a href="../../14/2017-09-14-do-you-hear-what-i-hear/">tone</a> of last Fall’s presidential election debates, I started exploring the content. What did the candidates talk about?</p>
<p>Content – themes, substance, issues, etc. – is a more challenging, but for my purposes, a more important, feature of this text. I started with some basic word frequencies.</p>

<p>Honestly, basic word frequencies revealed little of substance, so I’ll skip straight to the obligatory wordcloud (I’m pretty sure there’s a rule). To make the piechart of text visualization a little more interesting, I’ll do a comparison cloud to represent the words that are most distinctive to one of the speakers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># set up for figure
debatedf &lt;- as.data.frame(debatedfm) # turn into dataframe
hrcdf &lt;- rowSums(t(debatedf[1:13,])) # sum word use by candidate
djtdf &lt;- rowSums(t(debatedf[14:27,]))
d &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(hrcdf, djtdf))

# word comparison cloud (wordcloud)
colnames(d) &lt;- c(&quot;HRC&quot;, &quot;DJT&quot;)
comparison.cloud(d, max.words=200, 
                 scale=c(4,.33), random.order=FALSE, 
                 colors=c(&quot;blue3&quot;, &quot;orange3&quot;), title.size=1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-09-17-watch-what-you-say_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /> The bigger the word, the more its rate of appearance in one set of texts exceeds its rate of use across the entire collection.</p>
<p>For HRC we have: president, senator, support, think, work; some Sanders, Donald, health, and american; and bits of families, children, affordable, and working.</p>
<p>For DJT we have: going, country, people, say, look, great, and many; with some of tremendous, china, deal, wrong, disaster, bad, nobody; and smaller bits of million, money, mean. I struggle to find issue-related words here, except in some tiny words (russia, mexico, border, isis, obamacare). In part, this underscores how little substance was emphasized in these events.</p>
<p>One last angle (for this post) – another simple way to get a snapshot of the debate substance is to explore key-words-in-context for target words, like so:</p>

<p>Clinton’s use of the word family centered around paid family leave, worklife balance, military families, and the like. Trump’s use of family, by contrast, almost always referenced his own.</p>
<p>How about immigration? Here I’ll use a regular expression to extract multiple forms of the word.</p>
